# UGSC Multilingual Sentiment Dataset for Sustainable Mobility

This repository contains the multilingual version of the User Gold Standard Corpus (UGSC), designed for evaluating cross-lingual sentiment classification models in the context of sustainable urban mobility.

## Description

The dataset supports research on zero-shot multilingual sentiment analysis and contributes to reproducibility and benchmarking in NLP applications involving user-generated transport reviews.

It consists of sentence-aligned translations across five languages: English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.  
It is based on a manually annotated English corpus and has been used to evaluate the performance of a pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa sentiment classifier in a zero-shot setting.
